Software Engineering
--------------------
    Conciseness (brevity + clarity)
    Cohesion (each part only does one thing)
    Coupling (changes to one part won't impact others)
    Consistency (all parts look and feel similair)
    Correctness (meets requirements)
    Capacity (memory usage)
    Performance (speed of execution)

MVC

    We need SMART Models, THIN Controllers, and DUMB Views
