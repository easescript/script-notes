Shell Quoting - to enclose a single quote
=========================================

I was inspired by "Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide" [5.1. Quoting Variables](http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/quotingvar.html "5.1. Quoting Variables")

<blockquote>
<p>Single quotes (' ') operate similarly to double quotes, but do not permit referencing variables, since the special meaning of $ is turned off. 
Within single quotes, every special character except ' gets interpreted literally. 
Consider single quotes ("full quoting") to be a stricter method of quoting than double quotes ("partial quoting").</p>
<p>Since even the escape character (\) gets a literal interpretation within single quotes, trying to enclose a single quote within single quotes will not yield the expected result.</p>
</blockquote>
```bash
echo "Why can't I write 's between single quotes"

echo

# The roundabout method.
echo 'Why can'\''t I write '"'"'s between single quotes'
#    |-------|  |----------|   |-----------------------|
# Three single-quoted strings, with escaped and quoted single quotes between.

The script below is used to load data from a bash script. You can uncomment some lines to test different approaches.
```bash
  #!/bin/sh

  mysql -hmysql1 -Dmail -e "
  LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE '/tmp/spam.txt'
  INTO TABLE score
  FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
  #ENCLOSED BY '\'' (Created,Sender,Recipient,mail_id,Hits,size,ESMTP_id,response)
  ENCLOSED BY \"'\" (Created,Sender,Recipient,mail_id,Hits,size,ESMTP_id,response)
  "

  #mysql -hmysql1 -Dmail -e '
  #LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE "/tmp/spam.txt"
  #INTO TABLE score
  #FIELDS TERMINATED BY ","
  #ENCLOSED BY "'\''" (Created,Sender,Recipient,mail_id,Hits,size,ESMTP_id,response)
  #'
```
